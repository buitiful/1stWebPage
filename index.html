      <h2>Greetings.</h2>
      <p class="intro-description">I am a biology graduate who is interested in becoming a software developer. I enjoy teaching other individuals about the knowledge I acquired. I enjoy watching professional sports such as basketball, American football, and tennis. I hope to
        one day develop my own game application for cellphones. </p>

        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p class="skill-1-description">I enjoy tutoring younger individuals especially in the subject of math. I was a tutor in high school and even after I graduated college. Breaking down a concept into simple terminology and teaching it back to someone else are great ways to
          assess your own understanding. As a first generation college graduate in my family, I believe that knowledge is such powerful tool to possess. </p>

        <h3>Teamwork & Problem Solving</h3>
        <p class="skill-2-description">I particiapted in math and computer science competitions when I was in high school. I enjoyed working part of a team to solve difficult problems and learning from each other. Each difficult problem is like a puzzle that needs time and
          critical thinking to solve.</p>
